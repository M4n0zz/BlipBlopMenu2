Installation

Two are the possible ways of installing BlipBlopMenu2 on your current savegame.

Method 1:
By patching an already existing .sav file. This is by far the simplest method in case you are using an emulator or actual hardware with a gameboy cart reader.
To do so, you can use one of the following methods:
- Windows: Drag and drop your .sav file onto bbm.exe. Your savegame will automatically be patched.
- Using Python: Run the command below to patch your .sav file.
py bbm2.py [filename].sav


Method 2:
By injecting HEX code inside the game. This method requires a special proceedure that allows the player to build a bootstrap from glitching the game to the point where he is allowed to manipulate game's code by using ACE.
To use this method, you can follow "TimoVM's gen 1 ACE setups" tutorial and then follow the instructions included in .asm
